== Overview of Pool Design Method

The first step *(a)* in the pool design method is to represent the specified pool structure and construct library as linear directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this method, each edge in a DAG is labeled with a set of IDs for one or more genetic parts. Each path through a DAG from a green start node to a red stop node then represents one or more genetic constructs, each obtained by concatenating a single part identified on each edge in the path. Since the edges of a library DAG belong to a single path and are each labeled with a single part ID, each library DAG encodes a single construct. The edges of the specification DAG, on the other hand, are each labeled with multiple IDs of parts known to occur in the construct library. In this case, the specification DAG encodes all possible nifY transcriptional units (forward and reverse complement in orientation) that might occur in the construct library. Note that some IDs end with the character ‘^’ to indicate that the identified part occurs on the reverse complement strand.

The second step *(b)* is to take a tensor product of the specification DAG with the library DAGs. Briefly, this product produces a new set of DAGs in which each node corresponds to a combination of two nodes, one from the specification DAG and one from a library DAG. Each node a new DAG produced in this way is labeled with the union of the start/stop labels on the corresponding nodes in the original DAGs. Edges are then created between nodes in the new DAGs provided that edges exist between their corresponding nodes in the original DAGs and that the intersection of the IDs labeling these edges is non-empty (each edge is labeled with this intersection). The requirement for a non-empty intersection of labels is particular to this method.

The third step *(c)* is to determine which portions of the product DAGs correspond to complete matches (boxes) to the specification DAG. This is done by traversing the DAGs from each green start node and returning those paths that end with a red stop node. In addition, if such a path contains an edge that is labeled with an ID ending in ‘^’, then the labels of its start and stop nodes are swapped, the directions of its edges are reversed, and the IDs labeling each edge are processed as follows: if an ID does not end with ‘^’, then ‘^’ is concatenated to the end of that ID; otherwise, ‘^’ is removed from that ID. 

The final step *(d)* is to merge the DAGs for the complete matches into a single DAG that encodes the pool extracted from the construct library. Since each match DAG has a single path of the same length, the pool DAG can be obtained by constructing a linear DAG of this length and labeling each of its edges with the union of the IDs labeling the corresponding edges in the match DAGs.
